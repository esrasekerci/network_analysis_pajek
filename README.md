# Network Analysis of a Simulated Citation Graph

This repository contains the project files for the course **IS585: Network Analysis**, focused on simulating and analyzing a directed citation network using **Pajek**.

## Project Overview

The project explores how scholarly knowledge propagates through a simulated citation network of **150 nodes** and **675 directed edges**, each representing a scientific paper and its citations. Using structural and temporal metrics, we examine:

- **Centrality and authority**: Identify influential papers.
- **k-Core decomposition**: Reveal intellectual cores.
- **Clustering analysis**: Map tightly connected research communities.
- **Main path analysis**: Trace the most impactful citation pathways.
- **Temporal dynamics**: Understand knowledge evolution over time.

## Key Findings

- A small number of nodes (papers) dominate knowledge flow.
- The network exhibits a **moderate clustering coefficient** and **acyclic structure**.
- Citation influence follows a **skewed distribution**, consistent with real-world patterns.
- Main path analysis reveals a **clear trajectory** from foundational to frontier contributions.
